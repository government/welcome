# Government community on GitHub

Welcome to the government community on GitHub, a collaborative community for sharing best practices in furtherance of open source, open data, and open government efforts. To encourage open dialog, the community is a semi-private community, with only government employees having access.

## Who's eligible?

Anyone with a government email address is encouraged to participate, including national/federal, state, local, and municipal employees. That means if your email ends in `.gov`, `.gov.uk`, `ci.champaign.il.us`, etc., you are eligible. Also, you need to be human. Agency accounts and robots need not apply. 

If you're curious, [the constantly updated list of approved domains](https://github.com/benbalter/gman/blob/master/lib/domains.txt) is available as part of the [GMan open source project](https://github.com/benbalter/gman).

## How to join

In order to join the community, we must first confirm that you are, in fact, a government employee:

1. If you don't already have one, [sign up](http://github.com/join) for a GitHub account. GitHub accounts should be personal to you. Human-sounding names like @benbalter are prefered over organization-specific names like @benbalter_abc_agency.

2. Ensure that your government email is associated with your account. If you already have a GitHub account, you can simply [add your government email address](https://github.com/settings/emails) to your account.

3. [Confirm your government email address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-email-verification).

4. Visit [government-community.githubapp.com](https://government-community.githubapp.com/government/best-practices) in your web browser.

5. You should be automatically added and redirected to the GitHub Government community. You now have access to and can participate in the discussions available at [github.com/government](https://github.com/government).
